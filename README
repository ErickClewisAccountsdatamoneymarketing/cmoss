The CMOSS scripts can be used to build the following C/C++ Open Source Software libraries for native development on iOS and Android.

* c-ares : http://c-ares.haxx.se
* bzip2 : http://bzip.org/
* GnuPG, Libgcrypt, Libgpg-error : http://www.gnupg.org/
* OpenSSL - http://http://www.openssl.org/
* libSSH2 - http://www.libssh2.org/
* cURL - http://curl.haxx.se/
* expat - http://expat.sourceforge.net/
* yajl - http://lloyd.github.com/yajl/
* sqlcipher - http://sqlcipher.net/
* soci - http://soci.sourceforge.net/
* boost - http://www.boost.org/

The android kernel already provides some of these shared libraries so check if they are available before including them in your NDK project.

To run iOS build:

cd [cmoss root path]/build-ios
./build-all.sh [installed sdk version #] [proxy_host:proxy_port]

To run Android build:

cd [cmoss root path]/build-ios
./build-all.sh [path to Android NDK] [proxy_host:proxy_port]

These build scripts were tested on a Mac OS X 10 with the following Mac ports:

  cmake @2.8.4_0 (active)
  cppunit @1.12.1_0 (active)
  dos2unix @5.1.1_0 (active)
  expat @2.0.1_1 (active)
  gettext @0.18.1.1_2 (active)
  gperf @3.0.4_0 (active)
  libiconv @1.13.1_0 (active)
  libidn @1.20_0 (active)
  ncurses @5.8_0
  ncurses @5.8_1 (active)
  ncursesw @5.8_0 (active)
  openssl @1.0.0d_0 (active)
  wget @1.12_3+ssl (active)
  zlib @1.2.5_0 (active)

The Android scripts should work in a Linux environment but have not been tested.
